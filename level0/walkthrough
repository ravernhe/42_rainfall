# We have an executable, level0
# I run it and segfault, so I use the magic gdb
# I disas the main, to check where the segfault could be, and I run it nexti by nexti

# I find that I crash main+25 on the cmp
# But why ? Dunno, my var $eax empty ? Maybe I forget to but the ags, ups

# I run it with a random stuff ./level0 0
> No !

# I run it back with gdb --args level0 0
#bingo +25 don't segfault, so read content of the var $0x1a7,%eax
p $eax
> 0
p 0x1a7
> 423

# So i run ./level 423
# Bingo a shell open
